# Retail Inventory Management and Forecasting





## üïØÔ∏èOverview

Retail businesses face significant challenges in managing inventory efficiently while meeting customer demands. Stockouts and overstocking can both hurt profitability and customer satisfaction. This project aims to address these issues by developing a Retail Inventory Management and Forecasting System that will help retail businesses track their inventory, monitor sales, and forecast future stock requirements.<br>
The system will be designed to provide real-time inventory visibility and accurate demand forecasting using SQL databases and cloud services like Azure.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Goals

- Provide a comprehensive solution for managing retail inventory and predicting future demand.
- Track inventory, process orders, and manage sales data efficiently.
- Ensure real-time visibility into inventory levels.
 - Predict future stock requirements to avoid overstocking or understocking.
- Enhance decision-making processes for inventory, sales, and marketing strategies.



## üîé Project Breakdown:
  ### The Workflow was divided into four main phases:

#### 1- SQL Database Design and Implementation
1. Create a structured database schema tailored to the project requirements, ensuring efficient data organization and populate the database with sample data to facilitate testing and validation of database functionality.
3.  Develop SQL queries to extract meaningful insights that answer Bussiness Questions.


#### 2- Data Warehousing and Python Integration
1. Create a centralized data warehouse to store data from various sources.
2. Automate ETL processes to efficiently manage data flow into the data warehouse.
3. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare raw data for thorough analysis.

#### 3- Forecasting and Analysis
1. Build a forecasting model that utilizes historical data to predict future trends and demand.
2. Store data and conduct analysis using Azure services to derive actionable insights.
3. Evaluate the forecasting model's performance through rigorous testing and validation to ensure accuracy and reliability.

#### 4- MLOps and Deployment
1. Use MLflow to manage and track machine learning models throughout their lifecycle.
2. Deploy the forecasting model into a MLOps using Azure Machine Learning.
3. Create a user-friendly dashboard for visualization of predictions.
